# Order Synchronization Settings
# Control which order financial statuses are allowed for sync to RMS
# Valid statuses: PENDING, AUTHORIZED, PARTIALLY_PAID, PAID, PARTIALLY_REFUNDED, REFUNDED, VOIDED
# Default: PAID,PARTIALLY_PAID,AUTHORIZED,PENDING
# ALLOWED_ORDER_FINANCIAL_STATUSES=PAID,PARTIALLY_PAID,AUTHORIZED,PENDING
#
# Business Logic:
# - PENDING: Orders awaiting payment (recommended for full visibility)
# - AUTHORIZED: Payment authorized but not captured
# - PARTIALLY_PAID: Orders with partial payment received
# - PAID: Orders fully paid (conservative approach)
# - PARTIALLY_REFUNDED: Orders with partial refunds
# - REFUNDED: Fully refunded orders
# - VOIDED: Canceled/voided orders

# Guest Customer Configuration
# Allow orders without customer data (guest checkout)
ALLOW_ORDERS_WITHOUT_CUSTOMER=True
# Optional: Use a specific RMS customer ID for all guest orders (manual setup required)
# DEFAULT_CUSTOMER_ID_FOR_GUEST_ORDERS=
# Account number for auto-created guest customer in RMS (default: SHOPIFY-GUEST)

# Require customer email for all orders
REQUIRE_CUSTOMER_EMAIL=False

# Tax Discrimination Settings (Optional)
# Default tax percentage for Costa Rica IVA if not found in RMS
# DEFAULT_TAX_PERCENTAGE=13
#
# Maximum allowed price difference percentage between RMS and Shopify
# If difference exceeds this threshold, use Shopify's discriminated price
# PRICE_DIFFERENCE_THRESHOLD=10
#
# How tax discrimination works:
# 1. Get product price from RMS (already without VAT)
# 2. Check if promotion is active on order's processed_at date
# 3. Compare with Shopify price (discriminated: shopify_price / 1.13)
# 4. If difference > PRICE_DIFFERENCE_THRESHOLD%, use Shopify price
# 5. Otherwise, use RMS price (with or without promotion)
